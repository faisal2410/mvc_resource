1. Introduction to Event Sourcing in MVC
"In this screencast, we'll explore a powerful pattern for capturing every change in our application: Event Sourcing. Event sourcing lets us keep a complete history of all changes as a series of events. This can be particularly useful in applications where historical records are important, such as financial systems or audit logs."

"We'll dive into how Event Sourcing can be applied within the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure to manage data and track state changes, allowing us to rebuild the application’s current state at any point by replaying these events."

2. Implementing Event Sourcing Patterns within MVC Architecture
"To implement Event Sourcing within MVC, let's start with our basic application structure in MVC and add event handling. I'll use a simple PHP example where we have an application that manages user accounts with actions like registering, updating profiles, and deactivating accounts."

Step-by-Step Implementation
Set Up Models, Views, and Controllers:

"For this setup, I’ll use three main components:
A User Model to represent the user data.
A UserController to handle user actions.
Views to display user information."
Creating an Event Interface and Event Classes:

"We'll create an EventInterface to define common methods for events, like getEventType() and getPayload().
Then, we create event classes for each user action, such as UserRegistered, UserUpdated, and UserDeactivated."
php
Copy code
interface EventInterface {
    public function getEventType(): string;
    public function getPayload(): array;
}

class UserRegistered implements EventInterface {
    private $userId;
    private $data;

    public function __construct(int $userId, array $data) {
        $this->userId = $userId;
        $this->data = $data;
    }

    public function getEventType(): string {
        return 'UserRegistered';
    }

    public function getPayload(): array {
        return $this->data;
    }
}
Storing Events in the Database:

"In our database, we’ll create an events table to store each event as an immutable record."
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE events (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    payload JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Adding Event Logic in the Controller:

"In our UserController, each time an action is performed, we’ll create an event and save it in the events table."
php
Copy code
class UserController {
    public function registerUser($userData) {
        // Business logic to register a user
        // Save user data in the user table...

        // Create and store event
        $event = new UserRegistered($userId, $userData);
        EventStore::store($event);
    }
}

class EventStore {
    public static function store(EventInterface $event) {
        // Store event in database
        $pdo = Database::getPDO();
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO events (user_id, event_type, payload) VALUES (?, ?, ?)");
        $stmt->execute([$event->getUserId(), $event->getEventType(), json_encode($event->getPayload())]);
    }
}
3. Storing Events as Immutable Records and Rebuilding Application State
"Event Sourcing involves treating each event as an immutable record that describes a change in application state. Let’s explore how we store these events and rebuild the application state based on them."

Creating a State Rebuilder:

"We’ll create a StateRebuilder that reads all events from the events table and applies them to reconstruct the application state."
php
Copy code
class StateRebuilder {
    public static function rebuildUserState($userId) {
        $pdo = Database::getPDO();
        $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM events WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY created_at");
        $stmt->execute([$userId]);

        $userData = [];
        while ($event = $stmt->fetch()) {
            $userData = self::applyEvent($userData, $event);
        }

        return $userData;
    }

    private static function applyEvent($userData, $event) {
        $payload = json_decode($event['payload'], true);

        switch ($event['event_type']) {
            case 'UserRegistered':
                return $payload; // Initialize user data
            case 'UserUpdated':
                return array_merge($userData, $payload);
            case 'UserDeactivated':
                $userData['status'] = 'inactive';
                break;
        }

        return $userData;
    }
}
4. Managing the Complexity of Event-Driven Models in MVC Applications
"Event-driven models can introduce complexity, especially as the number of event types grows. We’ll look at ways to manage this complexity."

Event Aggregation:

"One approach is to periodically aggregate events to reduce the number of events needed to rebuild state. For example, creating monthly or quarterly snapshots for users."
Event Handlers and Dispatchers:

"Using a centralized EventDispatcher can help manage event propagation and triggering specific event listeners, which decouples the main application logic from event processing."
php
Copy code
class EventDispatcher {
    private static $listeners = [];

    public static function addListener($eventType, callable $listener) {
        self::$listeners[$eventType][] = $listener;
    }

    public static function dispatch(EventInterface $event) {
        foreach (self::$listeners[$event->getEventType()] as $listener) {
            $listener($event);
        }
    }
}
Implementing Logging and Monitoring:

"Implementing logs for each event and monitoring state changes will ensure that complex event-driven flows can be easily debugged and analyzed."
5. Conclusion and Key Takeaways
"In this screencast, we covered how to implement Event Sourcing within an MVC structure using PHP. By storing each action as an immutable event, we can keep a full history of changes, which allows us to rebuild the application state as needed."

"With Event Sourcing, MVC applications become more robust in handling complex data histories and event-driven requirements. However, managing event storage and complexity is critical, and using patterns like aggregation and monitoring will help."
